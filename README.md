# Analyzing AirBnb Data in Seattle  

## Project Overview

In this project, I analyze Airbnb activity in Seattle from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle). 

The Airbnb activity includes three datasets:

    1. Listings: full descriptions and average review score
    2. Reviews:  unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
    3. Calendar: listing id and the price and availability for that day

The attached notebook gathers, cleanses, models, and visualizes the dataset in order to evaluate the following questions:

    1. What types of places are the most expensive?  
    2. Predict overall listing price based on other factors about the property?
    3. What are the most requested neighborhoods in Seattle?
    4. What is the busiest times of the year for Seattle hosts?

The results of the analysis are summarised in a medium blog post available here: 

The repository includes: 
    
    1. Analyzing-AirBnB-Data-in-Seattle.ipynb
    2. listing.csv
    3. reviews.csv and calendar.csv can be found at the above Kaggle webpage. They are not included due to the 25MB file size limitation.
